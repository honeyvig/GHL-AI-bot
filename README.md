# GHL-AI-bot
Creating a GHL AI bot to call social media generated leads and prequalify them and book them in meetings.
===========
Creating a GHL AI bot to call social media-generated leads, prequalify them, and book meetings requires several components: integrating with social media platforms, using AI for interaction (via Natural Language Processing), telephony services for making calls, and scheduling meetings.

In this solution, I will guide you through the basic implementation steps using Twilio for calling, GoHighLevel (GHL) API for managing leads, and OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 for natural language interactions.
Requirements:

    Twilio Account for calling leads.
    GoHighLevel Account for CRM and lead management.
    OpenAI API Key for chatbot conversations.
    Calendly API (optional) or custom scheduling API to book meetings.

Steps to Develop the GHL AI Bot:

    Twilio Setup: Use Twilio for making voice calls and interacting with leads.
    OpenAI GPT Integration: Use GPT for natural conversation handling.
    CRM Integration: Store lead information in GoHighLevel and manage meeting scheduling.
    Meeting Scheduling: Use a service like Calendly or create a custom booking API.

Code Walkthrough:
1. Install Dependencies:

You'll need to install the necessary Python libraries.

pip install openai twilio requests flask

2. Setup Flask App:

Below is an example of how to create a basic Flask application that makes voice calls, interacts with leads, prequalifies them, and schedules meetings.

import openai
from twilio.rest import Client
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import os
import requests
from datetime import datetime

# Flask app setup
app = Flask(__name__)

# OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Twilio credentials
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_twilio_account_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_twilio_auth_token'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number'

# GoHighLevel API Key
GHL_API_KEY = 'your_ghl_api_key'

# Calendly API or Custom scheduling API URL
CALENDLY_API_URL = 'https://calendly.com/api/v1/meetings'

# Initialize Twilio Client
twilio_client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# Function to make a call using Twilio
def make_call(to_number, call_sid):
    # Call script for the bot (you can add custom TwiML here)
    twilio_client.calls.create(
        to=to_number,
        from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        url="http://your_flask_server_url/voice",
        method="GET",
        status_callback=f"http://your_flask_server_url/status/{call_sid}"
    )

# Function to interact with OpenAI GPT for conversation
def chat_with_gpt(message):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-4",  # You can also use "gpt-3.5-turbo" or any GPT model
        prompt=message,
        max_tokens=150,
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Function to create a new lead in GoHighLevel (GHL)
def create_ghl_lead(name, phone_number, status="new"):
    url = "https://api.gohighlevel.com/v1/leads"
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {GHL_API_KEY}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
    data = {
        'first_name': name,
        'phone_number': phone_number,
        'status': status
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Function to create a new meeting (e.g., using Calendly or a custom scheduling API)
def schedule_meeting(name, phone_number):
    meeting_details = {
        'name': name,
        'phone_number': phone_number,
        'meeting_time': datetime.now().isoformat()  # You can customize the time logic
    }
    response = requests.post(CALENDLY_API_URL, json=meeting_details)
    return response.json()

# Flask route for Twilio callback to handle voice interactions
@app.route("/voice", methods=["GET"])
def voice_interaction():
    # Set up TwiML response for handling conversation
    response = "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>"
    response += "<Response>"
    response += "<Say voice=\"alice\">Hello, this is your AI assistant. I would like to ask you a few questions to qualify you.</Say>"
    response += "<Gather action=\"/gather\" method=\"POST\">"
    response += "<Say>What is your name?</Say>"
    response += "</Gather>"
    response += "</Response>"
    return response

# Flask route to process responses from the voice interaction
@app.route("/gather", methods=["POST"])
def gather_response():
    # Get the speech-to-text response
    response = request.form['SpeechResult']
    
    # Use OpenAI to interpret the user's response and qualify the lead
    qualification_message = f"User said: {response}. Should I qualify them?"
    ai_response = chat_with_gpt(qualification_message)

    # Example logic to decide if the user qualifies for a meeting
    if "yes" in ai_response.lower():
        # Schedule the meeting and create lead in GHL
        lead = create_ghl_lead(name=response, phone_number=request.form['From'])
        meeting = schedule_meeting(name=response, phone_number=request.form['From'])
        return "<Response><Say>Thank you! A meeting has been scheduled.</Say></Response>"
    else:
        return "<Response><Say>Thank you! We will contact you later.</Say></Response>"

# Endpoint to start the call process
@app.route("/start_call", methods=["POST"])
def start_call():
    to_number = request.json['phone_number']
    call_sid = str(datetime.now().timestamp())
    
    # Initiate call using Twilio
    make_call(to_number, call_sid)
    return jsonify({"status": "Call initiated", "call_sid": call_sid})

# Main entry point for the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)

Key Components of the Code:

    Twilio Call Setup:
        The bot will call the lead and interact with them using a series of questions (via TwiML).
        Responses from the user are processed with SpeechResult and passed to the GPT-3 model for qualification.

    GPT-3 Interaction:
        The conversation with GPT-3 is designed to qualify the lead based on the answers provided by the user. It asks questions and evaluates responses.

    Lead Qualification and Meeting Scheduling:
        If the user qualifies, a lead is created in GoHighLevel (GHL), and a meeting is scheduled using either Calendly API or a custom API.

    GoHighLevel API:
        Leads and contact information are stored in GoHighLevel CRM. The API helps you manage leads more effectively.

    Meeting Scheduling:
        After qualifying the lead, the bot can schedule a meeting using the Calendly API or your own custom scheduling system.

Deployment and Testing:

    Deploy the Flask app: You can deploy this app on a cloud provider like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean to make it accessible publicly.
    Twilio Webhooks: Make sure to configure Twilioâ€™s webhook URLs (like http://your-flask-server-url/voice) in your Twilio dashboard.
    Integrate OpenAI: Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly set up for natural language processing.
    Test the flow: Test the call and interaction by starting with the /start_call endpoint and making sure all services (Twilio, GPT-3, GoHighLevel, etc.) are functioning correctly.

Conclusion:

This code structure offers a full AI-powered calling solution, capable of prequalifying leads and scheduling meetings automatically. You can customize the conversation flow, meeting scheduling, and lead management features based on your specific requirements. The project also integrates with CRM systems like GoHighLevel, providing an end-to-end automated lead qualification and meeting booking process.
